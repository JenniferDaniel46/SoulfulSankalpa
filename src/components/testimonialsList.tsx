        Jenn Daniel was my mentor when we met in 200hr yoga teacher training in 2023 at yoga pura. She proved to be dedicated, encouraging, and inspiring even when it was difficult to believe in myself. A year later as I find myself starting a path of teaching, I find I still have a mentor, instructor, counselor, and friend who has onlyever wanted me to succeed.

        It is clear to me that Jenn has chosen a path of inspiring growth in service to others. She has been sound counsel and helpful instruction regardless of where my path flows. If anyone is looking for a true professional who actually cares Ms. Daniel is a great place to start.`,

        Jenn was absolutely AMAZING. Her presence was so calming and warm and she was the perfect combination of professional and personal, which is tough to achieve when you're working so closely with people's feelings and emotions. The cacao ceremony is something I've never experienced before and it was SUCH a positive experience for me, I can't wait to do another. Jenn has a gift for putting others at ease the second she enters a room and is so skilled at what she does. I'll be calling her for every sound bath and cacao ceremony I ever do from here on out!
        Thank you so much for your expertise, Jenn!!`,

      My name is Kristen and I struggle with anger, I have my whole life from childhood trauma. When I became a mother, my struggles intensified. I was easily triggered and was in a constant state of reaction that I knew was affecting my children. I began a desperate search to find tools to help me break the cycles that were devastating my relationships and destroying my sense of worth as a mother.

      In January I attended Jenn's cacao ceremony and it introduced me to mother cacao. Jenn's beautiful description of her ancient medicine and spirit resonated with me
      deeply. I felt her warmth wrap around my heart as I inhaled her aroma for the first time. It began a heart opening journey that has led me to be calmer, more mindful, patient and loving as a mother. Mama cacao has become a driving force in my journey of letting go of my anger and becoming the mother my children need, the one I needed myself as a child.

      I've attended four ceremonies now and have also brought my eldest daughter (15). It gave us an opportunity to connect on a completely unique level and provide insight into my journey of overcoming my anger. Bringing understanding and compassion to our relationship, softening it and opening her heart to mama cacao as well.

      I cannot recommend these ceremonies enough. From the bottom of my heart, Jenn's cacao ceremonies have changed my relationships and my life. They are such a beautiful way to open your heart and welcome the change(s) you are seeking, whatever they might be.

      As someone new to yoga, I have taken a number of entry level classes with Jenn. She has been an amazing instructor and is attentive during the class.  She walks through the room providing encouragement or support to every one in class.  Every class I have taken with her has had a different flow and there is always a new pose that I have never done before.  Whether Jenn is encouraging you to take a more difficult pose or providing a simplified pose; she always makes the class accessible no matter your level.
